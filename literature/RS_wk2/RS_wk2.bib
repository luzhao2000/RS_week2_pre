This is inevitable to address this issue by means of identifying the causes which influence the level of employment. This paper determines the factors that influence the employment level in Pakistan. Four important independent variables are selected as determinants which include GDP Growth rate, inflation, FDI and Population growth rate. The correlation and multiple regression analysis reveal that GDP Growth rate and inflation have no significant relationship with the Unemployment. However, FDI and Population growth rate have significant and negative relationship with unemployment.},

  abstract = {Disparities in access to drinking water between rural and urban areas are pronounced. Although use of improved sources has increased more rapidly in rural areas, rising from 62\% in 1990 to 81\% in 2011, the proportion of the rural population using an improved water source remains substantially lower than in urban areas. Inequalities in coverage are compounded by disparities in other aspects of water service. Not all improved sources are safe and evidence from a systematic review demonstrates that water is more likely to contain detectable fecal indicator bacteria in rural areas. Piped water on premises is a service enjoyed primarily by those living in urban areas so differentiating amongst improved sources would exacerbate rural:urban disparities yet further. We argue that an urban bias may have resulted due to apparent stagnation in urban coverage and the inequity observed between urban and peri-urban areas. The apparent stagnation at around 95\% coverage in urban areas stems in part from relative population growth – over the last two decades more people gained access to improved water in urban areas. There are calls for setting higher standards in urban areas which would exacerbate the already extreme rural disadvantage. Instead of setting different targets, health, economic, and human rights perspectives, We suggest that the focus should be kept on achieving universal access to safe water (primarily in rural areas) while monitoring progress towards higher service levels, including greater water safety (both in rural and urban areas and among different economic strata).},

The model allows the rent-price ratio at each date to be split into the expected present discounted values of rent growth, real interest rates, and a housing premium over real rates. We show that housing premia are variable and forecastable and account for a significant fraction of rent-price ratio volatility at the national and local levels, and that covariances among the three components damp fluctuations in rent-price ratios. Thus, explanations of house-price dynamics that focus only on interest rate movements and ignore these covariances can be misleading. These results are similar to those found for stocks and bonds. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.}

Based on this hypothesis, we analyze the relationships between each of the two aspects and employment respectively. In this paper, the factors and the transmission mechanism of the influence that education has on employment are also explained. Then, the theoretical models of the relationship between education and employment are built up. Finally, we use the empirical data collected in China to test the theoretical models and give explanations to the status quo of the unemployment structure within various educational levels. It suggests that: the development of education in China at present is beneficial to the increase in the employment rate, the increase in the proportion of the laborers with junior school education has negative effects on employment, and the development of higher education creates positive effects on the employment, but no evidence shows any significant correlation between the proportion of the laborers with senior high school education and the unemployment rate.},

  abstract = {This paper provides early evidence of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on minority unemployment in the United States. In the first month following March adoptions of social distancing measures by states, unemployment rose to 14.5\% but a much higher 24.4\% when we correct for potential data misclassification noted by the BLS. Using the official definition, unemployment in April 2020 among African-Americans rose by less than what would have been anticipated (to 16.6\%) based on previous recessions, and the long-term ordering of unemployment across racial/ethnic groups was altered with Latinx unemployment (18.2\%) rising for the first time to the highest among major groups. Difference-in-difference estimates confirm that the initial gap in unemployment between whites and blacks in April was not different than in periods prior to the pandemic; however, the racial gap expanded as unemployment for whites declined in the next two months but was largely stagnant for blacks. The initially large gap in unemployment between whites and Latinx in April was sustained in May and June as unemployment declined similarly for both groups. Non-linear decompositions show a favorable industry distribution partly protected black employment during the early stages of the pandemic, but that an unfavorable occupational distribution and lower average skills levels placed them at higher risk of job losses. An unfavorable occupational distribution and lower skills contributed to a sharply widened Latinx-white unemployment gap that moderated over time as rehiring occurred. These findings of disproportionate impacts on minority unemployment raise important concerns regarding lost earnings and wealth, and longer-term consequences of the pandemic on racial inequality in the United States.},

Despite wide agreement by policymakers regarding the need for regulation of the housing market, there is close to no empirical evidence on the drivers of rent prices. We follow a comparative, quantitative approach to determine the driving factors of rent prices in German cities, taking economic, societal and political variables into account and using time-series analysis. Our results show that the share of students and the local mean income account for differences in quoted rent prices.}

The results, which are consistent across models, show that in San Francisco and the Bay Area obtaining (and maintaining) excellent ratings is, by far, the most important criterion, followed by reliable cancellation behavior of the host, host responsiveness, and sufficient Airbnb demand. Moreover, commercial Airbnb providers are more likely to obtain the superhost status.},

  abstract = {We consider which factors determined the price-rent ratio for the housing market in 18 U.S. metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) and at the national level over the period of 1975-2014. Based on a present-value framework, our proposed empirical model separates the price-rent ratio for a given market into unobserved components related to the expected real rent growth and the expected housing return, but is modified from standard present-value analysis by also including a residual component that captures non-stationary deviations of the price-rent ratio from its present-value level. Estimates for the modified present-value model suggest that the present-value residual (PVR) component is always important and sometimes very large at the national and MSA levels, especially for MSAs that have experienced frequent booms and busts in the housing market. In further analysis, we find that house prices in MSAs that have larger PVR components are more sensitive to mortgage rate changes. These are also the MSAs with less elastic housing supply. Also, comparing our results with a recent statistical test for periodically-collapsing bubbles, we find that MSAs with large estimated PVR components are the same MSAs that test positively for explosive sub-periods in their price-rent ratios, especially during the 2005-2007 subsample. Our approach allows us to estimate the correlation between shocks to expected rent growth, the expected housing return, and the PVR component. We find that the expected housing return and movements in the PVR component are highly positively correlated implying an impact of the expected housing return on house prices that is amplified from what a standard present-value model would imply. Our results also show that most of the variation in the present-value component of the price-rent ratio arises due to the variation in the expected housing return.},

The paper uses detailed data from Glasgow and the west central Scotland conurbation, first to indicate how the massive outward movement of residential population to the suburbs and beyond had slowed to the extent that the distribution of residential population between core city, suburban ring and exurbs was almost unchanged in 1981-88, and secondly to show how the inner city's share of the conurbation's employment actually rose after 1984.},

  abstract = {Air pollution and ageing populations are two of the most important issues facing in the development of all countries around the world, and the resulting debate between air pollution and labour supply has become increasingly intense. This paper uses data from the 2017 China Migrants Dynamic Survey (CMDS data), exploring the impact of perceived air pollution on labour supply of the migrants based on the perspective of the hetero­ geneity of different groups’ sensitivity to air pollution. After overcoming the reverse causality between perceived air pollution and labour supply using an instrumental variables approach, we find that there is a significant negative effect of perceived air pollution on labour supply. At the same time, this negative effect shows some heterogeneity in terms of the presence of susceptible persons in the family, workers’ income levels and household registration. Therefore, in the current economic and social development, in addition to improving measured air quality, it is also necessary to focus on improving the perceived air quality of citizens, as well as improving the working environment of the vulnerable groups in the labour market and protecting their basic labour rights and interests, which is of positive significance for the continuation of the demographic dividend and providing impetus for high-quality and sustainable economic development.},

Population surfaces are generated using small area data (enumeration districts or output areas) for each Census from 1971 to 2011 inclusive. The paper details the methods used in the creation of these surfaces, and discusses the rationale behind this approach, arguing that grids represent the most appropriate model for assessing population distributions. Methods for grid creation are tested using pre-existing population grids for Northern Ireland as a benchmark. The method developed is then applied to create population grids for the rest of the UK for 1971, 1981, 1991, 2001 and 2011. The changing population structures of small areas across these five time points are explored here to illustrate the value of this approach. The publically-available data resource – the final product of the ‘PopChange’ project – will facilitate exploration of long-term changes in populations over small areas. The paper argues that maximum advantage could be taken of the ‘big data revolution’ if such data were gridded in a similar way, allowing them to be placed in a longer-term historical context, using tools made available through the PopChange project.},

  abstract = {Purpose: House price-to-rent (P-t-R) ratios are among the most widely used measures of housing market conditions. Given the theoretical and apparent bidirectional, causal relationships and imbalances between the housing market, broader economy and financial market determinants, it is important to understand the relationship between macro- and micro-economic characteristics in relation to the P-t-R ratio to enhance the understanding of housing market dynamics. This paper studies the joint dynamics and persistence of house prices and rents and examines the temporal interactions of the P-t-R ratio and economic and financial determinants. Design/methodology/approach: The authors examine the lead–lag relationships between the P-t-R ratios and a spectrum of macroeconomic variables using cointegration and causality methods, initially at the aggregate position and also across housing types within the Northern Ireland housing market to establish whether there are subtle differences in how various housing segments react to changes in economic activity and market fundamentals. Findings: The findings reveal price switching dynamics and some very distinct long- and short-run relationships between macroeconomic and financial indicators and the P-t-R ratios across the various housing segments. The results exhibit monetary supply, foreign exchange markets and the stock market to be important drivers of the P-t-R ratio, with P-t-R movements seemingly tied, or are in tandem, with the overall economy, particularly with the construction sector. Practical implications: The study shows that the P-t-R ratio can be used as an early measure for establishing the effects of macroprudential policy changes and how these may manifest across housing tiers and quality, which can further act as a signal for preventing or at least mitigating future irrational price cyclicity. These insights serve to inform housing and economic policy and macroprudential policy design, principally within lending policy and the effect of regulatory interventions and further enhance the understanding of the P-t-R ratio on housing market structure and dynamics. Originality/value: This study is the first in the housing literature that examines the causal relationships between the P-t-R ratio and macroeconomic activity at the sub-market level. It investigates whether and how money supply, inflation, foreign exchange markets, general economic productivity and other important macroeconomic factors interact with the pricing of different property types over time.}

GIS-based indicators are constructed combining different data sources such as census and administrative data. This methodology is applied in a case study in Rosario (Argentina) and demonstrates how urban indicators and GIS combined are a valuable tool to describe and monitor inequality aspects such as quality-of-life conditions and access to services in order to better target resources.},

  abstract = {Rapid and unplanned urban growth has adverse environmental and social consequences. This is prominent in sub-Saharan Africa where the urbanisation rate is high and characterised by the proliferation of informal settlements. It is, therefore, crucial that urban land use/land cover (LULC) changes be investigated in order to enhance effective planning and sustainable growth. In this paper, the spatial and temporal LULC changes in Blantyre city were studied using the integration of remotely sensed Landsat imageries of 1994, 2007 and 2018, and a geographic information system (GIS). The supervised classification method using the support vector machine algorithm was applied to generate the LULC maps. The study also analysed the transition matrices derived from the classified map to identify prominent processes of changes for planning prioritisation. The results showed that the built-up class, which included urban structures such as residential, industrial, commercial and public installations, increased in the 24-year study period. On the contrary, bare land, which included vacant lands, open spaces with little or no vegetation, hilly clear-cut areas and other fallow land, declined over the study period. This was also the case with the vegetation class (i.e., forests, parks, permanent tree-covered areas and shrubs). The post-classification results revealed that the LULC changes during the second period (2007–2018) were faster compared to the first period (1994–2007). Furthermore, the results revealed that the increase in built-up areas systematically targeted the bare land and avoided the vegetated areas, and that the vegetated areas were systematically cleared to bare land during the study period (1994–2018). The findings of this study have revealed the pressure of human activities on the land and natural environment in Blantyre and provided the basis for sustainable urban planning and development in Blantyre city.},

  abstract = {The differential urbanisation model postulates that the urbanisation process occurs over a series of stages of concentration and deconcentration of population over space and time. For the first cycle of urban development, the model postulates six stages of population change within the broad spectrum of urbanisation, polarisation reversal, and counter-urbanisation. This paper, utilising population census data in urban size categories for the period of 1961–91, tests the differential urbanisation model in the context of a developing country, India. The analysis reveals that at the national level, India has moved from the large city stage of the concentration phase of urbanisation as observed during the earlier decades (1961–81) to the Early Intermediate stage of the deconcentration phase during the 1981–91 period. The analyses at the subnational levels show mixed patterns that include a gradual emergence of the smaller urban centres in relative importance. The paper notes that some growth patterns observed in India vary from the postulated phases in the model and suggests that intra-stage and inter-stage transitional phases should be examined in future cross-cultural studies for possible theoretical implications.},

Fluctuations in the price to rent ratio over time, can be traced to either changes in expectations of future house price growth (expected returns) or rental growth. In this paper, we measure the impact of these latent variables in Scotland’s main cities by implementing a state-space model based on the present value. The model estimates show that the proportion of expected rent growth and expected returns driving the price to rent ratio differs across Scotland. Glasgow seems to be driven mostly by expected returns, while rent growth drives price movements in Edinburgh. A geographic dimension is noted as cities on the East coast share similar expected returns and expected rent growth. Housing market trends in Scotland mostly follow the Edinburgh experience. Further decompositions show that house price changes are driven by an equal combination of expected rent growth and expected returns in Dundee and Aberdeen.}

The crisis of unemployment has been in existence for a long time. Nevertheless, in the developed nations it was experienced in its severe form at the time of the great depression (1930's) while in the developing nations it was after the Second World War (1945). The past few years, there has been a slowdown in the growth of employment in India despite the boost in the economic sector. At the same time due to this COVID-19 pandemic lockdown, there had been a devastating effect on the unemployment rate in India as most of the private companies have fired their employees. The main sufferers of this lockdown are the informal sector employees as the majority of them started losing jobs since construction works were closed. With no capital, thousands of people deserted cities, marching to their homelands for several hundreds of miles away in the absence of government transportation, which showed their intensity of anguish. This paper aims to delineate the impact of COVID-19 on unemployment in our study area. For analyzing this research we mostly relied on secondary data collected through books, journals, newspapers, authentic internet sources, etc The outcome of this research will be helpful for academicians, researchers, and policymakers in related studies.},

Currently, it is difficult to track social, economic, environmental and health outcomes in cities with high spatial and temporal resolution, needed to evaluate policies regarding urban inequalities. We applied a deep learning approach to street~images for measuring spatial distributions of income, education, unemployment, housing, living environment, health and crime. Our model predicts different outcomes directly from raw images without extracting intermediate user-defined features. To evaluate the performance of the approach, we first trained neural networks on a subset of images from London using ground truth data at high spatial resolution from official statistics. We then compared how trained networks separated the best-off from worst-off deciles for different outcomes in images not used in training. The best performance was achieved for quality of the living environment and mean income. Allocation was least successful for crime and self-reported health (but not objectively measured health). We also evaluated how networks trained in London predict outcomes three other major cities in the UK: Birmingham, Manchester, and Leeds. The transferability analysis showed that networks trained in London, fine-tuned with only 1\% of images in other cities, achieved performances similar to ones from trained on data from target cities themselves. Our findings demonstrate that street~imagery has the potential complement traditional survey-based and administrative data sources for high-resolution urban surveillance to measure inequalities and monitor the impacts of policies that aim to address them.},

Multiple types of data from different sources are often available for a given geographic area. Yet, most studies utilize a single type of input data when making measurements due to methodological difficulties in their joint use. We propose two deep learning-based methods for jointly utilizing satellite and street level imagery for measuring urban inequalities. We use London as a case study for three selected outputs, each measured in decile classes: income, overcrowding, and environmental deprivation. We compare the performances of our proposed multimodal models to corresponding unimodal ones using mean absolute error (MAE). First, satellite tiles are appended to street level imagery to enhance predictions at locations where street images are available leading to improvements in accuracy by 20, 10, and 9\% in units of decile classes for income, overcrowding, and living environment. The second approach, novel to the best of our knowledge, uses a U-Net architecture to make predictions for all grid cells in a city at high spatial resolution (e.g. for 3 m × 3 m pixels in London in our ex­ periments). It can utilize city wide availability of satellite images as well as more sparse information from streetlevel images where they are available leading to improvements in accuracy by 6, 10, and 11\%. We also show examples of prediction maps from both approaches to visually highlight performance differences.},

We take the central districts of Dalian city as the research area and measure environmental equity across different socioeconomic residential areas using the Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance. The results reveal the spatial disparities in physical activity facilities, street greening, and positive perceptions between different communities. However, green injustice is mitigated in the hilly neighborhoods when we consider only ground-level greenness.

  abstract = {There is much discussion regarding the Sustainable Development Goals’ (SDGs) capacity to promote inclusive development. While some argue that they represent an opportunity for goal-led alignment of stakeholders and evidence-based decision-making, other voices express concerns as they perceive them as a techno-managerial framework that measures development according to quantitatively defined parameters and does not allow for local variation. We argue that the extent to which the positive or negative aspects of the SDGs prevail depends on the monitoring system’s ability to account for multiple and intersecting inequalities. The need for sub-nationally (urban) representative indicators poses an additional methodological challenge—especially in cities with intra-urban inequalities related to socio-spatial variations across neighbourhoods. This paper investigates the extent to which the SDG indicators’ representativeness could be affected by inequalities. It does so by proposing a conceptual framing for understanding the relation between inequalities and SDG monitoring, which is then applied to analyse the current methodological proposals for the indicator framework of the “urban SDG,” Goal 11. The outcome is a call for (1) a more explicit attention to intra-urban inequalities, (2) the development of a methodological approach to “recalibrate” the city-level indicators to account for the degree of intra-urban inequalities, and (3) an alignment between methodologies and data practices applied for monitoring SDG 11 and the extent of the underlying inequalities within the city. This would enable an informed decision regarding the trade-off in indicator representativeness between conventional data sources, such as censuses and household surveys, and emerging methods, such as participatory geospatial methods and citizen-generated data practices.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Unemployment has been a subject for numerous studies and recent debates in South Africa and beyond. This paper explores the relationship between education level and unemployment among the youth in four municipalities in O.R Tambo District (ORTDM), Eastern Cape, South Africa. The theory of human capital provided the theoretical underpinning of the connection between education level and unemployment, and also the theory was used to interpret the findings. It is assumed that by conducting this investigation, an important contribution is made to theoretical developments in the education and jobs sectors literature and policy in South Africa. Research methods: The study participants were selected using the systematic random sampling since the study employed a quantitative research paradigm. The cross-sectional survey design was implemented. The data consisted of 120 self-completed survey questionnaires from the studied employable young people. The crosstabulation, correlation, chi-suqare data analyses methods were used while the multiple regression model developed was used to test the relationships. Findings: From the analyses, relationships were established such that educational level was found to positively relate to unemployment and was also found to have the highest effect on unemployment. Furthermore, result show negative correlation between economic status and education qualification, while it was positively correlated to unemployment. Lastly, a weak linear relationship exists between level of education and economic status. Implications for research and practice: The findings provide an opportunity for education policy makers to collaborate with the government(s) to develop strategies that favour employment. The results mean that a recurring production of education and training into the labour market is not accompanied by a reduction in unemployment. Future studies may investigate other issues responsible for increasing unemployment in the country despite economic improvement as well as the moderating role of race.},

  abstract = {With the integration of multiple energy systems, there are more and more deterioration risks of power quality in different energy production, transformation, delivery and consumption stages. Automatic classification of power quality disturbances is the foundation to deal with power quality problem. From the traditional point of view, the identification process of power quality disturbances should be divided into three independent stages: signal analysis, feature selection and classification. However, there are some inherent defects in signal analysis and the procedure of manual feature selection is tedious and imprecise, leading to a low classification accuracy of multiple disturbances and a poor noise immunity. This paper proposes a novel full closed-loop approach to detect and classify power quality disturbances based on a deep convolutional neural network. Considering the characteristics of power quality disturbances problem, a unit construction which consists of 1-D convolutional, pooling, and batch-normalization layers is designed to capture multi-scale features and reduce overfitting. In the proposed deep convolutional neural network, multiple units are stacked to extract features from massive disturbance samples automatically. Comparisons with other state-of-the-art deep neural networks and traditional methods proves that the proposed method can overcome defects of traditional signal process and artificial feature selection. Considering microgrid is an important development form of multi-energy system and an essential part of smart grid, a typical simulation system is constructed to analyze the causes of power quality problems in microgrid and the field data from a multi-microgrid system are used to further prove the validity of the proposed method.},
