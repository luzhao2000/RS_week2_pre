  abstract = {The effect of the expansion of urban impervious surfaces on surface urban heat islands (UHIs) has attracted research attention due to its relevance for studies of local climatic change and habitat comfort. In this study, using five satellite images of Xiamen city, Southeast China (four images from the Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and one from the Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager/Thermal Infrared Sensor (OLI/TIRS)) acquired in summer between 1989 and 2016, together with spatial statistical methods, the changes in impervious surface area (ISA) were investigated, the spatiotemporal variation of the intensity of urban heat islands (UHIs) was explored, and the relationships between land surface temperature (LST) and the percentage of impervious surface area (ISA\%), the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and fractional vegetation coverage (Fv) were investigated. The results showed the following: (1) According to the biophysical composition index (BCI) combined with an ISA post-processing method, Xiamen has witnessed a substantial increase in ISA, showing a 6.1-fold increase from 1989 to 2016. The direction of ISA expansion was consistent throughout the study period in each of the five districts of Xiamen; (2) a bay-like UHI form is observed in the study area, which is remarkably distinct from the central-radial UHI form observed in previous studies of other cities; (3) the extent of UHIs in Xiamen greatly increased between 1989 and 2016, experiencing a 4.7-fold increase in UHI areas during this time. However, during the same period, the urban heat island ratio index (URI)—that is, the ratio of UHI area to ISA—decreased slightly. The UHI area decreased in some urban parts of Xiamen due to a significant increase in vegetation coverage, urban village redevelopment, and the construction of new parks; (4) sea ports and heavy industrial zones are the greatest contributor to surface UHI, followed by urban villages; and (5) LST is strongly positively correlated with ISA\%. Each 10\% increase in ISA was associated with an increase in summer LST of 0.41 to 0.91 K, which compares well with the results of related studies. This study presents valuable information for the development of regional urban planning strategies to mitigate the effects of UHIs during rapid urbanization.},

  abstract = {The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the Department of Interior United States Geological Survey (USGS) are developing the successor mission to Landsat 7 that is currently known as the Landsat Data Continuity Mission (LDCM). NASA is responsible for building and launching the LDCM satellite observatory. USGS is building the ground system and will assume responsibility for satellite operations and for collecting, archiving, and distributing data following launch. The observatory will consist of a spacecraft in low-Earth orbit with a two-sensor payload. One sensor, the Operational Land Imager (OLI), will collect image data for nine shortwave spectral bands over a 185 km swath with a 30 m spatial resolution for all bands except a 15 m panchromatic band. The other instrument, the Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS), will collect image data for two thermal bands with a 100 m resolution over a 185 km swath. Both sensors offer technical advancements over earlier Landsat instruments. OLI and TIRS will coincidently collect data and the observatory will transmit the data to the ground system where it will be archived, processed to Level 1 data products containing well calibrated and co-registered OLI and TIRS data, and made available for free distribution to the general public. The LDCM development is on schedule for a December 2012 launch. The USGS intends to rename the satellite “Landsat 8” following launch. By either name a successful mission will fulfill a mandate for Landsat data continuity. The mission will extend the almost 40-year Landsat data archive with images sufficiently consistent with data from the earlier missions to allow long-term studies of regional and global land cover change.},

  abstract = {Time-series datasets of Land Surface Temperature (LST), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Built Index (NDBI) and other climatic factors are of significance due to their application in tracking climate change in cities. In this paper, new data processing methods are presented using the application of Google Earth Engine (GEE) and GIS. Different variables including LST (both daytime and nighttime), NDVI, NDBI, rainfall, wind speed, evapotranspiration, and surface soil moisture were computed for 18 years from 2000 to 2018 with of use of GEE platform. The study areas cover 20 top global cities which were mentioned in the global cities index report in 2018 [1]. The data sources used on GEE are: MODIS Terra LST and Emissivity 8-Day Global 1km; MODIS Terra Vegetation Indices 16-Day Global 1km; MODIS Terra Surface Reflectance 8-Day Global 500 m; TRMM Monthly Precipitation Estimate data; Terra Monthly Climate; MODIS Terra Net Evapotranspiration 8-Day Global 500 m; and NASA-USDA SMAP Global Soil Moisture Data. Also, to gather information regarding the global cities, United Nations (UN) population dataset, cities elevation and the A.T.Kerney report [1] was used. A short description of GEE functions to retrieve variables is provided. The dataset can be used to investigate the spatialtemporal relationships between LST, vegetation and built-up areas, as well as to provide the global perspective of climate and population change in various cities around the world.},

  abstract = {Rapid and unplanned urban growth has adverse environmental and social consequences. This is prominent in sub-Saharan Africa where the urbanisation rate is high and characterised by the proliferation of informal settlements. It is, therefore, crucial that urban land use/land cover (LULC) changes be investigated in order to enhance effective planning and sustainable growth. In this paper, the spatial and temporal LULC changes in Blantyre city were studied using the integration of remotely sensed Landsat imageries of 1994, 2007 and 2018, and a geographic information system (GIS). The supervised classification method using the support vector machine algorithm was applied to generate the LULC maps. The study also analysed the transition matrices derived from the classified map to identify prominent processes of changes for planning prioritisation. The results showed that the built-up class, which included urban structures such as residential, industrial, commercial and public installations, increased in the 24-year study period. On the contrary, bare land, which included vacant lands, open spaces with little or no vegetation, hilly clear-cut areas and other fallow land, declined over the study period. This was also the case with the vegetation class (i.e., forests, parks, permanent tree-covered areas and shrubs). The post-classification results revealed that the LULC changes during the second period (2007–2018) were faster compared to the first period (1994–2007). Furthermore, the results revealed that the increase in built-up areas systematically targeted the bare land and avoided the vegetated areas, and that the vegetated areas were systematically cleared to bare land during the study period (1994–2018). The findings of this study have revealed the pressure of human activities on the land and natural environment in Blantyre and provided the basis for sustainable urban planning and development in Blantyre city.},

  abstract = {The thermal infrared bands of Landsat 7 ETM+ and Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS have ability to provide Land Surface Temperature (LST) information. This information is important to map and monitor Earth surface’s temperature-related events such as drought. However, these two Landsat sensors have different conversion methods of deriving LST information from their image pixels. Landsat 7 ETM+ applies a simple algorithm using single thermal band to produce an index of surface temperature; while Landsat 8 TIRS applies two thermal bands and a more sophisticated Split Windows Algorithm (SWA). This research aims to compare and contrast the ability of Landsat 7 ETM+ and Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS to map LST for drought monitoring in part of East Java Province, Indonesia. Drought detection was conducted using two different algorithms, namely Temperature Condition Index (TCI) with a range of values from 0-100 and Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI) with a range of 0-1. These algorithms have an opposite index value explanation; zero in TCI indicates drought condition, but wet condition in CWSI. The differences in the LST results from Landsat images showed that SWA method provides more similar results to the corresponding land cover conditions as compared to the result of Landsat 7 ETM+. Drought detection results demonstrate that TCI and CWSI would be optimally useful for area have a potential drought. Both methods have similar results in terms of the condition of Land Surface Temperatures.},

  abstract = {Due to the abundant features of high spatial resolution (HSR) remote sensing images, change detection of these images is crucial to understanding the land-use and land-cover (LULC) changes. However, previous works mostly focus on traditional binary change detection without considering the semantic information of the change classes. The latest progress of deep learning (DL) shows its advantages in HSR remote sensing images change detection. However, due to the large number of parameter calculations, the DL network always requires a large quantity of labeled data. In addition, DL methods for change detection usually follow a patch-based learning framework, which considers only the local area and leads to a sample imbalance problem for semantic change detection. To address the above issues, we first proposed a Siamese global learning (Siam-GL) framework, which is a novel semantic change detction framework for HSR remote sensing images. In Siam-GL, the Siamese architecture with shared parameters is constructed to effectively extract the representative features of bi-temporal HSR remote sensing images. The global hierarchical (G-H) sampling mechanism is designed to address the imbalanced training sample problem with insufficient samples. Furthermore, the binary change mask is added between the encoder and decoder to weaken the influence of the no-change regional background on the change regional foreground, further improving the accuracy of the proposed framework. The experimental results obtained with three diverse HSR datasets of typical Chinese cities demonstrated that the Siam-GL framework outperforms the advanced semantic change detection methods in terms of both quantity and quality. Moreover, to verify the generalization performance of the Siam-GL framework, a larger dataset was used for evaluation, and the results show that the Siam-GL framework has strong generalization performance.},
