  abstract = {Rapid and unplanned urban growth has adverse environmental and social consequences. This is prominent in sub-Saharan Africa where the urbanisation rate is high and characterised by the proliferation of informal settlements. It is, therefore, crucial that urban land use/land cover (LULC) changes be investigated in order to enhance effective planning and sustainable growth. In this paper, the spatial and temporal LULC changes in Blantyre city were studied using the integration of remotely sensed Landsat imageries of 1994, 2007 and 2018, and a geographic information system (GIS). The supervised classification method using the support vector machine algorithm was applied to generate the LULC maps. The study also analysed the transition matrices derived from the classified map to identify prominent processes of changes for planning prioritisation. The results showed that the built-up class, which included urban structures such as residential, industrial, commercial and public installations, increased in the 24-year study period. On the contrary, bare land, which included vacant lands, open spaces with little or no vegetation, hilly clear-cut areas and other fallow land, declined over the study period. This was also the case with the vegetation class (i.e., forests, parks, permanent tree-covered areas and shrubs). The post-classification results revealed that the LULC changes during the second period (2007–2018) were faster compared to the first period (1994–2007). Furthermore, the results revealed that the increase in built-up areas systematically targeted the bare land and avoided the vegetated areas, and that the vegetated areas were systematically cleared to bare land during the study period (1994–2018). The findings of this study have revealed the pressure of human activities on the land and natural environment in Blantyre and provided the basis for sustainable urban planning and development in Blantyre city.},

  abstract = {The monitoring and assessment of land use/land cover (LULC) change over large areas are significantly important in numerous research areas, such as natural resource protection, sustainable development, and climate change. However, accurately extracting LULC only using the spectral features of satellite images is difficult owing to landscape heterogeneities over large areas. To improve the accuracy of LULC classification, numerous studies have introduced other auxiliary features to the classification model. The Google Earth Engine (GEE) not only provides powerful computing capabilities, but also provides a large amount of remote sensing data and various auxiliary datasets. However, the different effects of various auxiliary datasets in the GEE on the improvement of the LULC classification accuracy need to be elucidated along with methods that can optimize combinations of auxiliary datasets for pixel- and object-based classification. Herein, we comprehensively analyze the performance of different auxiliary features in improving the accuracy of pixel- and object-based LULC classification models with medium resolution. We select the Yangtze River Delta in China as the study area and Landsat-8 OLI data as the main dataset. Six types of features, including spectral features, remote sensing multi-indices, topographic features, soil features, distance to the water source, and phenological features, are derived from auxiliary open-source datasets in GEE. We then examine the effect of auxiliary datasets on the improvement of the accuracy of seven pixels-based and seven object-based random forest classification models. The results show that regardless of the types of auxiliary features, the overall accuracy of the classification can be improved. The results further show that the object-based classification achieves higher overall accuracy compared to that obtained by the pixel-based classification. The best overall accuracy from the pixel-based (objectbased) classification model is 94.20\% (96.01\%). The topographic features play the most important role in improving the overall accuracy of classification in the pixel- and object-based models comprising all features. Although a higher accuracy is achieved when the object-based method is used with only spectral data, small objects on the ground cannot be monitored. However, combined with many types of auxiliary features, the object-based method can identify small objects while also achieving greater accuracy. Thus, when applying object-based classification models to mid-resolution remote sensing images, different types of auxiliary features are required. Our research results improve the accuracy of LULC classification in the Yangtze River Delta and further provide a benchmark for other regions with large landscape heterogeneity.},

  abstract = {Photovoltaic (PV) technology is becoming more popular due to climate change because it allows for replacing fossil-fuel power generation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Consequently, many countries have been attempting to generate electricity through PV power plants over the last decade. Monitoring PV power plants through satellite imagery, machine learning models, and cloud-based computing systems that may ensure rapid and precise locating with current status on a regional basis are crucial for environmental impact assessment and policy formulation. The effect of fusion of the spectral, textural with different neighbor sizes, and topographic features that may improve machine learning accuracy has not been evaluated yet in PV power plants’ mapping. This study mapped PV power plants using a random forest (RF) model on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. We combined textural features calculated from the Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM), reflectance, thermal spectral features, and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI), and Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) from Landsat-8 imagery and elevation, slope, and aspect from Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) as input variables. We found that the textural features from GLCM prominent enhance the accuracy of the random forest model in identifying PV power plants where a neighbor size of 30 pixels showed the best model performance. The addition of texture features can improve model accuracy from a Kappa statistic of 0.904 ± 0.05 to 0.938 ± 0.04 and overall accuracy of 97.45 ± 0.14\% to 98.32 ± 0.11\%. The topographic and thermal features contribute a slight improvement in modeling. This study extends the knowledge of the effect of various variables in identifying PV power plants from remote sensing data. The texture characteristics of PV power plants at different spatial resolutions deserve attention. The findings of our study have great significance for collecting the geographic information of PV power plants and evaluating their environmental impact.},
